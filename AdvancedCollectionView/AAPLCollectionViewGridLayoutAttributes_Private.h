 Abstract:
 
  A subclass of UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes with additional attributes required by the AAPLCollectionViewGridLayout, AAPLCollectionViewCell, and AAPLPinnableHeaderView classes.
  
  This file defines some additional attributes that used for internal communication between the layout and cells. In most cases, alternate means of accessing this information exists.
